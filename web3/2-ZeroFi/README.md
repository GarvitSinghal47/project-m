# ZeroFi
## Aim:
ZeroFi is the website integrated with the Machine Learning and Blockchain that helps to provide microloans to people with Zero-interest
loans, pure CSR. In developing countries like India, there are lots of talented people
who want to start their own business/some work but can't do that due to lack of funds to
build infrastructure like websites, hire competent team members, etc.
They can't take loans from banks as they don't have any collateral to provide to banks in
addition to huge waiting time and processing charges to get your application approved.

## Features:
• No credit score needed <br />
• No collateral required<br />  • 0% interest< 100,000 <br />
• No fees<br />
• 30-day crowdfunding
